        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Elon Reeve Musk is a technology entrepreneur, investor, and engineer. He is the founder of SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, and The Boring Company. Musk is also known for his ambitious goals, such as colonizing Mars and developing a hyperloop transportation system. He was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended at the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University. After two days, he dropped out and with his brother Kimbal, co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. In 1999, Zip2 was acquired by Compaq for $307 million and Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal, which eBay acquired for $1.5 billion in 2002.</p>
        
        <p>What I admire most about Elon Musk is his relentless pursuit of innovation and progress. He is constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible and challenging conventional thinking. Musk has a rare combination of vision, determination, and technical expertise that has allowed him to achieve what many thought was impossible.</p>
